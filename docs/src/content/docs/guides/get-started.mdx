> The purpose of this project is to provide a simple-to-use RPC framework for any environment JavaScript/TypeScript can run, not just http.
>
> In fact, it was not created for http. http support is just a side effect of the design. If you are looking for a http RPC library, you might want to check out [tRPC](https://trpc.io/).

> This project is created for building extension system for a Tauri app (https://github.com/kunkunsh/kunkun).
>
> Its potential can be used in other types of apps, so I open sourced it as a standalone package.

## Environment

- http
  - Make RPC calls over HTTP like calling local functions (similar to tRPC)
- WebSocket
  - Make RPC calls over WebSocket
- Web Worker
  - Make RPC calls over Web Worker (similar to [comlink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink))
- iframe
  - Make RPC calls over iframe (similar to [comlink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink))
- stdio
  - Make RPC calls over stdio between JavaScript/TypeScript processes (e.g. Node.js/Deno/Bun)
- Chrome Extension
  - Make RPC calls between content script and background script
- Tauri
  - Make RPC calls between Tauri app and bun/deno/node backend (like Electron)

All environments (except for http) support bidirectional calls and callbacks.
i.e. both sides can expose API methods to each other on the same connection.

## Install from NPM

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install kkrpc
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add kkrpc
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add kkrpc
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Install from JSR

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="deno">
    ```bash
    deno add jsr:@kunkun/kkrpc
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    npx jsr add @kunkun/kkrpc
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```bash
    bunx jsr add @kunkun/kkrpc
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx jsr add @kunkun/kkrpc
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Recommended Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
